# pibot

Our pibot is a two-wheeled robot who's movement is controlled by a Sony playstation 4 controller & and Raspberry Pi using ds4drv+Python.
The goal is to have the robot use two webcams to record & patch together 3D video on the fly, while outputting the result to an internet stream.
Another goal is to mount the webcams on a servo motor to give the robot the ability to look in different directions.


This repository will hold all the source code/relevant commands for out project.
